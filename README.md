Welcome to my GitHub project!

My 2024 New Year's resolution is to learn JavaScript, and what better way to learn than to create my own app?

In this repository I am building a calendar app which allows the user to view, insert, and delete calendar events.

Front End:
Written in TypeScript and CSS. I quite like the strictness of TypeScript relative to JavaScript, as it makes debugging a lot easier.

Back End:
Written in JavaScript. Perhaps not the most natural choice for back-end software, but the objective here isn't so much efficiency but rather learning a new language.
